    "1. Acquire basic knowledge about Python and Matplotlib\n",
    "2. Gain familiarity with Juypter Notebooks\n",
    "3. Gain familiarity with the PySpark API and SparkSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve such goals, we will go through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In section 1, **IPython** and **Jupyter Notebooks** are introduced to help students understand the environment used to work on Data Science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In section 2, we briefly overview **Python** and its syntax. In addition, we cover **Matplotlib**, a very powerful library to plot figures in Python, which you can use for your Data Science projects. Finally, we introduce **Pandas**, a python library that is very helpful when working on Data Science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In section 3 we cover the **PySpark** and **SparkSQL** APIs\n",
    "\n",

    "**Python** is a high-level, dynamic, object-oriented programming language. It is a general purpose language, which means that many things are made easy. It's designed to be easy to program and easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IPython** (Interactive Python) is orignally developed for Python. Now, it is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages. It offers rich media, shell syntax, tab completion, and history. IPython is based on an architecture that provides parallel and distributed computing. IPython enables parallel applications to be developed, executed, debugged and monitored interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter Notebooks** are a web-based interactive computational environment for creating IPython notebooks. An IPython notebook is a JSON document containing an ordered list of input/output cells which can contain code, text, mathematics, plots and rich media.  That makes data analysis easier to perform, understand and reproduce. All laboratories in this course are prepared as Notebooks. As you can see, in this Notebook, we can put text, images, hyperlinks, source code... The Notebooks can be converted to a number of open standard output formats (HTML, HTML presentation slides, LaTeX, PDF, ReStructuredText, Markdown, Python) through `File` -> `Download As` in the web interface. Beside, Jupyter manages the notebooks' versions through a `checkpoint` mechanism. You can create checkpoint anytime via `File -> Save and Checkpoint`.\n",

The JVM works as the actual Spark driver, and loads a `JavaSparkContext` that communicates with the Spark executors across the cluster. Python API calls to the Spark Context object are then **translated into Java API calls** to the JavaSparkContext. For example, the implementation of PySpark's `sc.textFile()` dispatches a call to the `.textFile` method of the `JavaSparkContext`, which ultimately communicates with the Spark executor JVMs to load the text data from HDFS. \n",

For example, running `sc.textFile()` in the Python interpreter will call the `JavaSparkContexts` `textFile` method, which loads the data as Java String objects in the cluster.\n",

Any necessary Python processing is executed in the interpreter, and the resulting data is stored back as an RDD (as pickle objects by default) in the JVMs. \n"

Besides, we started to gain practical experience with PySpark and SparkSQL, using as an example a dataset concerning US flights."
